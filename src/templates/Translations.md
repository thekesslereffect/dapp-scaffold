ROOT'N TOOT'N POOT'NONOMICS (You can translate this to Tokenomics)

Dev's Stash
To keep our devs fueling the backend where the real magic happens!

Treasury Fund
This is our fragrance of fortune, our eau de toilette, used for giveaways to bring in newcomers with the promising scent of Poot profits! 2% of these funds will go towards 'GOOD CAUSE' initiatives and charities, ensuring we can smear Poot all around the globe!

The Big Splash
Dropping your kids off at the pool? We're dropping 90% of our Poot into the liquidity pool and burning the LP tokens, ensuring our pool's always full and forever fun!

Burn Baby Burn!
100% of the LP Tokens have been burnt. So, you don't need to worry about getting into a sticky shituation.
