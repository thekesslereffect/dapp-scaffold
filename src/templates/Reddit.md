Hi! I'm building Poot Coin! Solana's #2 Memecoin. AMA!

Hi, I'm Poot Dev, the creator of Poot Coin on Solana. I am a 3D character artist during the day and a web3 developer at night. I created Poot Coin because I noticed there was a ton of crap in the memecoin space, but no true shitcoin. So, we are looking to fill that deep dark hole... with $POOT!

Roadmap

Community Building Memes, Contests, Giveaways, PFP Creator, Emoticons, etc.

Games First one currently in progress and actually playable.

Merch Hoodies, Sticker Packs, Doggie Bags, Plushies

NFTs Multiple styles to pick from. All will be minted using $POOT

More! Many more plans down the line like setting up a DAO and Multisig for Treasury Funds, potential collabs, animated series, etc.

Tokenomics

90% locked liquidity with 100% LP tokens burned.

8% Split between Treasury (6%) and a GOOD CAUSE Initiative (2%) where we plan to supply the world with better Pooting infrastructure and overall just make the world a better place.

2% Dev Fund for keeping the backend regular.

Feel free to ask me any questions you have, and remember:
Here with Poot Coin, we don't strive to be #1 because... well... we're #2!
