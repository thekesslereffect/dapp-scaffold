Background and Experience in the Space
  Im Nick. Otherwise known as Poot Dev. I'm the creator of Poot Coin, Solana's #2 Memecoin.
  I'm a 3D character artist during the day, and I guess a web3 developer at night. 
  I have been in the space since the 2021 bullrun through all the ups and downs, and eventually found my place in NFTs.
  I ended up creating a Polygon NFT project back in December of 2021. 
  Where During that time I learned how to write Solidity contracts, I made websites implementing web3 tech, and also maintained a community on Discord.
  So I know what it takes to run a web3 project. 
  That's why, when I looked at the solana ecosystem, I was like "you know.. something has to be done". There is all this crap out there but not one is a true shitcoin.
  So, I created Poot Coin. A shit coin with an actual roadmap and plan. Not just some contract represented by an image of a dog.

What is POOT all about, What is the Inspiration behind it.
  
  I wanted something recognizable and something that already exists as an emoji. There's no guessing as to what it is. Not like something made in MS Paint. It's something people can relate to it. People can text each other or write posts using it. You know, almost like try to create subliminal messages whenever someone sees the poop emoji. It will make them think of our character Poot. And sure the dog meme business is booming, but thing thing is  Only some people have dogs... but everyone Poots.
  
  As far as the current design of Poot.
  Being able to appeal to multiple markets was sort of at the top of my list for design language. The west seems to love asian style, so I took inspiration from Hello Kit and Gudetama. 
  You know, Just trying to keep things Simple, and cute. 
  But Poot comes in many shapes and sizes, so there may be some more evolutions along the way, but I think we are close to having a brand that is easily recognizable and adaptable for different styles.


What is the utility of POOT
  Right now Poot is just an SPL token. It's just a contract with some metadata living on the solana network somewhere.That's typically were memecoins stop.
  But Im from the Polygon NFT space. Shit there is cut throat. You have to have staking, swapping, merch, nfts that evolve over time. If you aren't innovating, you arent going anywhere.
  And that's what Im bringing to the solana ecosystem with Poot.

  First off
  I will be creating a game similar to flappy bird where the community can play if they hold POOT and mark their name on the leaderboards. 
  This will let them cash in on the treasury wallet funds we have set up, participate in community contests, or you know, just compete against their friends.

  The second utility is
  You will be using this Poot to pay for merch through our shop. Anything from stickers or keychains, to hoodies and i dont know, doggie bags and plushies. Just depends on what the community wants.
  
  Third utility
  will be staking it to earn our forth utility: NFTs as a reward for keeping tokens off the market. We will team up with some artists to create unique NFTs holders can choose from. A whole ecosystem of different styles ranging from pixel art poots, to 3d animated renders, and poot that changes over time.

  These are the more solid utility plans for Poot at the moment. Future plans are a a little more runny.
  Obviously a project run by one guy is risky. You want to have a members board of people that have a vision for the project that can provide suggestions and insite.
  So in the future we want to create some sort of governance model for Poot. A DAO where people can vote for proposals using Poot to cast their vote on certain issues like: who to choose as the next artists, or how treasury funds should be allocated.

  And finally we would really like to give back through initiatives like one tree planted or carbon offset programs, so we can make a difference outside the digital world.


Why Sol
  It's the current hotspot for memecoins, so it's an ecosystem where Poot Coin can flourish.
  "You want to poop where the toilets are," and Solana provides the perfect infrastructure and plumbing for that.

Tokenomics
  Supply of 1Billion with 0% tax
  90% is locked in the liquidity pool. LP Tokens were burnt.
  8% Are currently in Treasury wallets. Later next month we plan transfer those to a multisig wallet so community treasury members can use them for giveaways and quests.
  The last 2% is a dev fund.


Airdrops / Rewards coming up?
  No airdrops. We want the community to work for it and help us succeed.
  We will be having giveaways throughout the week where people can randomly win Poot,
  but we also plan to release some sort of Quests for making memes and twitter posts. That way the word spreads while the community has fun.


Long Term Plan and Marketing Plans
  We need to keep the community engaged in activities that revolve around POOT. We released a PFP builder on our website where people can go to generate Poots and use them for memes and their profile pictures.
  As far as marketing, the whole space is riddled with people trying to make a quick buck off your project. I get tons of DMs a day of people offerring marketing services, so it makes it really hard to figure out who is legit or not.
  Right now we are looking to break into the asian markets through influencers, and after that we will be getting in contact with some professional marketting agencies. 
  It's funny. I was actually super confused when the marketing agent sent me a message in telegram because it was so professional. I was so used to seeing all the shills and shit coming in that I was like wait how do you even know my name.
  But anyways yeah we're currently in progress on the marketing side of things.


Why should people hold our token for the long term
  We are creating a brand, not just some memecoin. We plan to make Poot Coin usuable for transactions to purchase merch and even every day items.

Any Staking Plans
  Yeah so introduces a couple issues that we need to think through. First it gives whales even more control of the project. If they have a lot of POOT coins then they would earn more utility tokens. 
  Secondly, it removes utility from POOT. So we need to be careful with how we implement staking. There have been several ideas presented within the community such as needing to purchase a secondary token called a Plunger to release the utility token from the staking contract. A plunger would only be able to release a set amount of utility tokens based on its amount. The more utility or staked tokens you have in the contract the better plunger you need to buy. Plungers would be bought with POOT. 
  As far as the utility of Poot being removed, we could also bypass the need for a utility token altogether and just make staking redeem other sorts of assets like NFTs as a reward for removing tokens from the market.

Where can we get POOT
  The easiest way is to go to the website POOT.LOL. There you can check out our information and roadmap so you know what we plan to do, and then there is a link to buy that will take you to dexscreener. From there you can find the link to the raydium contract to purchase Poot.
